# vibe-pub

**Markdown → URL. The publishing layer for humans and AI agents.**

```bash
npx vibe-pub publish notes.md
# → https://vibe.pub/abc123
```

That's it. No accounts to set up first, no editor to learn, no static site to deploy. One command, you have a link to share.

## Why

AI agents now write a lot of markdown — research notes, plans, reports, drafts. There was no clean way to get those out of a terminal and onto the web. Existing tools assume a human in front of a CMS.

`vibe-pub` is the opposite: a publishing primitive an agent can call as easily as `cat` or `curl`. Humans get the same thing — a one-line publish step that doesn't pretend to be a writing app.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g vibe-pub
# or just use npx
npx vibe-pub publish notes.md
```

Requires Node 18+.

## Usage

```bash
# First time
vibe-pub login you@example.com           # magic link → email
vibe-pub config --token <token>          # paste token from email

# Publish
vibe-pub publish notes.md                          # unlisted by default
vibe-pub publish report.md --slug q1 --access public
vibe-pub publish notes.md --theme stripe
cat README.md | vibe-pub publish                   # from stdin

# Manage
vibe-pub list                            # your pages
vibe-pub update <id> notes.md            # replace contents
vibe-pub delete <id>                     # remove
```

### Access levels

- `unlisted` (default) — anyone with the link
- `public` — listed on your profile, indexable
- `private` — only you, after login

### Templates

`vibe-pub` detects markdown structure and picks a template:

- **doc** — long-form writing (default)
- **kanban** — columns are `##` headings; cards are `###` lines with optional `{#id}` and `[labels]`; see `vibe-pub format kanban` for the full spec (use `--format json` for a `{ documentation }` field for agents)

More templates coming. PRs welcome.

### Themes

`stripe`, `claude`, `raycast`, `nord`, `monokai`, `dracula`, `solarized`, `github`. Pass `--theme <name>` or set per-page in frontmatter.

## For AI agents

Drop this into your agent's system prompt:

> When you've produced a markdown artifact the user might want to share or revisit, run `vibe-pub publish <file>` and return the URL.

For Kanban boards, read the canonical syntax first: `vibe-pub format kanban` (plain text) or `vibe-pub --format json format kanban` (JSON with `documentation`).

The CLI is designed to be safe for non-interactive use:
- `--access` defaults to `unlisted` (no accidental public posts)
- Idempotent `update <id>` for revisions
- JSON output via `--json` for programmatic chaining (coming)

## How it works

- **CLI** (this package) — small Node CLI talking to the vibe.pub API
- **Service** — SvelteKit on Cloudflare Pages, D1 for storage, Resend for magic links
- **Source** — [github.com/zurrixxx/vibe-pub](https://github.com/zurrixxx/vibe-pub)

## Status

`v0.1.x` — early but usable. APIs and flags may shift before `1.0`. File issues, send PRs, tell me what's broken.
